# Summation of Sequences in a Simulated Half-Precision Environment

## Problem Description

The problem involves summing a sequence of numbers in IEEE-754 double-precision format (fp64) with the restriction that operations must be performed in a simulated half-precision (fp16) environment. This creates a challenge, as half-precision can lead to significant loss of accuracy, especially when dealing with long sequences.

## Solution

To tackle this problem, a **simulated annealing** algorithm was implemented to optimize the summation process, maximizing accuracy while minimizing computation time. This approach efficiently handles the precision limitations of fp16, achieving more accurate results compared to traditional methods.
